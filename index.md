TFT Display for Raspberry Pi 3
===============================

The Idea:
=========

I will work to make a touchscreen work with a raspberry pi 3. This project will let the user know His/Her position in line while he waits to get attention of a representative or an attendant.
Users can also lookup a product in store and once they are done shopping, they can fill out an E-Survey using a simple and interactive touch screen.

I had some time to kill today, so I tried to search of ways I can mirror my screen to another computer for remote access and also because writing code on a 3.5'' screen was very frustrating.

Guess what!!! I downloaded teamviewer on my personal laptop and my Raspberry Pi from [here](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/) and followed the instructions [here](https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-install-TeamViewer-Host-for-Linux/ta-p/6318) to get things to work. It works like a charm without any lag. :computer: This means, that I can use my laptop's screen to use the Raspberry Pi. The only catch is that both the devices have to be on-line.

I have tested the PCB board that I sodered and it works fine. The LED is blinking and the the Sensors are reading. :simple_smile: <br>

My screen even works when I install it over the PCB board.

Got my PCB Board tested by Vlad at the Prototype lab. It works Perfect!!!
### November 20 2017
The Touch Screen is now displaying and taking inputs. The whole process to get it to work took almost 6 to 8 hours.

I used [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-3-dot-5-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi/easy-install) website for help and closely followed the steps.

Stay tuned for Videos, Pictures and Build instructions that are coming soon.

Created [Budget](https://github.com/SaqibJaweed/Help-Line/blob/master/Budget.docx), to keep track on the project's affordability.
### September 25, 2017
Created [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/SaqibJaweed/Help-Line/blob/master/Gantt%20Chart.docx), that would help me to finish all tasks on defined time and stay on track.
### September 18, 2017
Created [proposal](https://github.com/SaqibJaweed/Help-Line/blob/master/ProposalContentStudentNameRev02.xlsx) for a 3.5'' TFT display. The display will be used as a default display for input and output.
